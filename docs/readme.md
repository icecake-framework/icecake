# Icecake Framework Documentation

Icecake Framework documentation is composed of a website and [go doc comments](https://go.dev/doc/comment).

The published website is generated within this `/docs` directory and served by github pages.

Sources of this website are in `/web/docs` directory.

Go doc comments are written directly at package level within the `/pkg` and `/internal` directories. They can be viewed on the [go package directory](https://pkg.go.dev/) as soon as the project will be published. Until then you can run `godoc -http=:6060` locally.
